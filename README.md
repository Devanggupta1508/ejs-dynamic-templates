# ejs-dynamic-templates
This project demonstrates how to use EJS templating with Express.js to create dynamic web pages. It covers key concepts such as template interpolation, serving static files, and rendering dynamic content from a JSON file. The project simulates an Instagram-like profile page, where data is fetched dynamically based on user input.
